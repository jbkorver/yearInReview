       <h2>July - 2009</h2>
       <p>At the beggining of the month I drove back to Iowa for one of two 20 year class reunions that I would be attending this year. I was on my way back to Charles City where I attended school from kindergarden through 9th grade. Shawn stayed home to oversee the pouring of the foundation for our garage.</p>
       <p>After my reunion, my mother met me in Charles City and we spent a few days talking to some of the small towns in the area trying to find some more communities for <a href="http://jubon.biz">Jubon</a>.</p>
       <p>I accepted the position I was offered last month and began the job by taking a trip to KTLA in Las Angeles where I spent a couple intensive days learning how a TV station works. </p>
       <p>The foundation was poured for our garage just in time for Shawn's father to pay us another visit. This time he and Shawn worked tirelessly on the garage.</p>
