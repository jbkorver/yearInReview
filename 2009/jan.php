       <h2>January - 2009</h2>
       <p>Here is a glimpse into our 2009.</p>
       <p>On the first of the year, <a href="http://jubon.biz">Jubon.biz</a> went live. This is a new online business that I started with my mother and my brother. It was my mom's idea, I created it and my brother financed it. It is an online, interactive map. There is a little red car (the Jubon 8) that &quot;drives&quot; around the town. That is, if you click on a street, the car will drive to that location. If the new location is in front of a business or organization who is part of Jubon, then a billboard will appear with their information and links. That's the basic idea. We are focusing on rural communities under 10,000. We are trying to work with the local Chamber of Commerce or a motivated individual for each new community. We started with my mother's home town,  Orange City, IA, and  hope to expand well past that in the future.</p>
       <p>Shawn and I continued to run through out most of the month. We were running</p>
     </div>
      <div class="main_mid">
        <p> 4 times a week, but unfortunately, Shawn was experiencing quite a bit of pain in his heal. Our longest run at this point was 16 miles.</p>
        <p>During the middle of the month, Shawn's father spent a week with us to help us on the house. It always amazes me how much the two of them can accomplish when they work together. A few highlights during his visit included determining the design, layout and even the number of rooms that we will have upstairs. They also worked on nearly all of the doors  currently in use and made them open and close smoothly eliminating the drafts. This might not sound like much, but is quite an large feat in a house that is over 100 years old. The most exiting project they worked on was to replace one of the windows upstairs. This was a trial run as we will eventually replace almost all the windows in the house.</p>
