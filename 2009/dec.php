       <h2>December - 2009</h2>
       <p>At the beginning of the month, I had a business trip in Norfolk, VA. It was helpful to meet some of the people I've been working with.</p>
       <p>The temperatures have dropped low enough that we can no longer work on painting the garage and instead Shawn has been spending his time preparing the future dining room. The way we have the house set up is that only the rooms that are completed or at least insulated and partially completed are the ones that we are living in and heating. </p>
       <p>I love any progress that we make in the house, but by far the most exciting are the ones were we get to start using another room in the house. Just in time for my mother's Christmas visit, Shawn opened up the future dining room to our use. It is the only room in the house that has new windows and the floor is fully repaired. It looks great and will give me space for my sewing and quilting at least for a few months before we move</p>

      <div class="main_mid">   <p>another rooms stuff into this new room in order to build the open staircase.</p>
        <p>Regardless of how long it lasts, I love having a sewing room again.</p>
        <p>Just before Christmas, my mother and step father arrived. It had been 3 or 4 years since they had seen the house. I think they were impressed with the improvements. </p>
        <p>All in all, it was a fantastic year. I'm greatful for my friends and family, but most of all for my incredible husband, Shawn!</p>
