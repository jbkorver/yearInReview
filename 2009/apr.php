       <h2>April - 2009</h2>
       <p>While we were on the road for the last 6 or 7 weeks, we didn't do much running primarily because of the pain Shawn was experiencing in his foot (plantar fasciitis), but towards the end of the trip, we decided that we wanted to get back to it and we still wanted to run the Nashville 1/2 marathon. That meant that we only had 3 and 1/2 weeks to  prepare.</p>
       <p>We had no problem with the training, but we were met with many surprises at the race. There were nearly 30,000 people running the race and we started in the 23rd corral which meant that almost 22,000 people started before we did. It took us 45 minutes after the official start for our corral to go over the start line. </p>
        <p>Starting that far back resulted in our need to  weave and bob in and out of slower moving racers through out nearly the entire race. However, the worst part of the race was the heat. It was nearly 90 degrees and we had no idea how different it was running in the heat.</p>

      <div class="main_mid">
      <p>But regardless, the race was incredible and had large numbers of people on the sidewalks watching and cheering.  The race was part of the Rock and Roll series, so there were multiple bands playing along the route.  The energy level was through the roof and it was really quite a bit of fun.  All except for the heat.  </p>
