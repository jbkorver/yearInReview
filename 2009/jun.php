       <h2>June - 2009</h2>
       <p>The house was still priority number 1, but both Shawn and I were excited about the potential job offer that I received to do some programming in the television broadcasting industry.</p>
       <p>My father and step mother stopped by to see us and to see the improvements we've made on the house.</p>
       <p>To save some money, Shawn and I tried to remove a tree from our backyard that had to come down before we could have the foundation poured for our future garage. The tree turned out to be a little larger than we thought, but we did get most of it ourselves before we had to call in the professionals.</p>
