       <h2>September - 2009</h2>
       <p>I stated out the month in CA babysitting, but was able to take a weekend off to meet up with some of my disc golfing buddies and actually play another tournament which to my surprise resulted in a win and one heck of a fun weekend!</p>
       <p>Shortly after the tournament, I flew back to IA to meet my mother in Cedar Rapids for a convention of Iowa Chamber of Commerce leaders. We made a presentation for Jubon and met some potential new clients.</p>
       <p>I was only in Iowa for a few days and then flew back to CA for Shawn's cousin's wedding. We stayed with his father, and met his sister's fiance on the very short visit.</p>
       <p>When we returned home, we had about a day before we had to get back in the car and drive down to Augusta, GA for the PDGA fall summit.</p>

       <p>Now that the temperatures have decreased a bit, Shawn and I have started running again with the goal of running another 1/2 marathon before the end of the year.</p>
