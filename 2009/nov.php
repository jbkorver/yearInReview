       <h2>November - 2009</h2>
       <p>Shawn and I continue to run and are pleased at the improvements that we have made. We decided to run in the Atlanta 1/2 marathon that was held on Thanksgiving day. It was a completely different experience that the Nashville 1/2 marathon earlier in the year. For one, we barely got to the race intime in Atlanta and there were chain link fences with only a few openings that allowed runners to get into the correct corrals before the race started. There were so many people, that we couldn't get into the corral. We were stuck with many other people trying to wiggle our way in when the race started. Of course as people started running in the corrals, the people outside the fence where able to get in and join the race. The weather was great it was around 50 degrees I believe. Quite early on, we got in with a group of people who were all running near our same pace so we didn't have to bob and weave through the crowd like we did in Nashville. We managed to finish in 1:54:33 and felt great!</p>

        <p>On the way home I mentioned that I thought it was a shame that we were going to take some time off now and that our next race wasn't until March. We were also curious if we could go much farther if we slowed down a bit. So on Sunday, 3 days after the 1/2 we put our running shoes back on and set out to try and run 20 miles. It didn't take long before I was feeling the pain of multiple blisters, but I did manage to finish the 20 mile route. Shawn felt good enough that at 20 miles he wanted to continue. He completed a full 26.2 with a pretty respectable time of around 4:17.</p>
