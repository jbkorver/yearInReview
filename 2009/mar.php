       <h2>March 2009</h2>
       <p>After Vegas, we drove to Phoenix to see my father and step mother. We spent a week with them before driving farther west to CA where we spent a week with Shawn's father and step mother at the ranch they are care takers for. </p>
       <p>The next stop was a brief one at my brother's house in Atherton, CA, where we were only able to stay for a few days as we had decided to hit another disc golf tournament in Fort Collins, CO on our way back east. </p>
       <p>While in Colorado, we stayed with our good friends, Sue and Peggy who also played in the St. Patrick event in Fort Collins. </p>
       <p>After CO, we drove to my mother's home in northwest Iowa. My mother and I took part in a ribbon cutting ceramony for <a href="http://jubon.biz">Jubon.biz</a>. Shawn and I spent a few days in the community talking to 6 or 8 local businesses who where interested in having us create websites for them.</p>
