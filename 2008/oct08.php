       <h2>October - 2008</h2>
       <p>Shawn and I spent a week in Rock Hill, SC for the United States Disc Golf Championships.  Shawn wasn’t interested in playing and was still buried with computer work.  He took his computer and giant monitor along and tried to work in the hotel room during the day.  He suffered through some ridiculously slow connections and managed to get a little work done. I marshaled the event.</p>
       <p>After returning home, I spent much of my time working on a new computer project.  The previous month, my mother convinced Clint and I to start a new company with her.  The company is called Jubon.  The product is based on something that she has been thinking about for a few years.  She wanted to create a website that allows small communities to have an online presence.  The idea is that there will be a map of the town and every Jubon customer will have an icon on the map.  </p>
      </div>
      <div class="main_mid">
       <p>There is a little car that drives around the map depending on where you click.  If the car stops in front of an icon, a popup will appear with information about that location.  That’s the general idea.  If you want to see how it works take a look at: <a href="http://jubon.biz" target="_blank">jubon.biz</a>.  We are still in beta and we have only worked with one community yet, but hope to expand to many more communities in the coming years.</p>
       <p>The other interesting thing that happened in October is that Shawn and I started training to run a marathon.  We found a 16 week program that we decided to try.</p>
