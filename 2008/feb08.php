       <h2>February - 2008</h2>
       <p>In February Shawn spent the majority of his time on the house as our primary client had little to no work for us.  We tried to stay warm, hoped for a full recovery for my arm and anxiously waited for the end of the month and our next trip.  </p>
       <p>On the 25th I had a doctor’s visit.  I had been free of the cast for 11 days.   Although I thought my range of motion for my wrist was quite poor, the doctor told me it was way above average for the small amount of time I had been without the cast.  He asked me how I thought my progress was going.  I told him I thought it was very poor as I wasn’t able to do pushups yet.  He nearly dropped his clip board and I decided to make my expectations a bit more reasonable.  </p>

       <p>With the appointment behind me, we were off to Vegas for our first disc golf tournament of the year, the Gentlemen’s Club.  Of course, I didn’t play.  Little did I know at the time, that I wouldn’t play any tournaments in 2008.  I was unable to play until about April, and then I just never felt the desire to play one after that.       </p>
