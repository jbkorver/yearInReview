       <h2>January - 2008</h2>
       <p>The year started with a bang, but not the kind we might have hoped for.  Just a few days before the New Year, Shawn and I joined my brother, Clint and his two girls, Serena and Sophia for four days on the slopes of Squaw Valley in the Lake Tahoe area.  Just before lunch on day 1, I caught the heel edge of my board and slammed down backwards.  Instinctively I put my arms out to catch my fall.  Thankfully I was wearing a helmet as I hit my head with some force.  There was also a lot of force on my right arm as it took most of the impact.  It wasn’t so lucky.  I ended up with what the doctor’s called “mush” at the end of my radius.  Surgery was discussed but dismissed as there wasn’t anything solid enough to pin or plate to.  </p>

        <p>Thankfully, everything was pretty much in the correct spot.  They didn’t even have to set anything which was nice.  Obviously this injury kept me away from disc golf for the first part of the year.  It also had a negative impact on my ability to work on the house, use the computer efficiently or knit.  I was still able to quilt so I spent quite a bit of time putting together a few T-shirt quilts that I had waiting for me.        </p>
